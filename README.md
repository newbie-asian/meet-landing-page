## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
 First, I identified all components needed in this project and then structured my HTML markup using the mobile-first approach. I created this app using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. I created some custom components and utilities. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first time using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS

The most important lesson I learned in this project are the following:
- How to use Tailwind CSS with ReactJS
- How to create components
- What are props
- What is JSX
- How to deploy your site using Vercel

### Continued development

After this project, I want to continue with a more challenging project by having interactions with Javascript not only static HTML and CSS. And hopefully soon go to the backend development.
